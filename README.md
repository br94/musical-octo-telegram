This Repository contains Shell-Scripts to prepare fresh installations of various Linux Distributions.

```
Themes
```

In the Themes Folder you'll find two Folder: 
Mate Tweak Panel Layout 
and
Numix Based Mate Theme.

Those two Files will arrange the panels and set the theme to what i think is the most comfortable to work with.

How to install the Themes?

1) Run the ubuntu installation script or copy the lines which pull the numix theme and icons
2) Copy "Numix" in "Numix Based Mathe Theme" to '~/.themes/Numix'
3) Copy both files in "Mate Tweak Panel Layout" to '/usr/share/mate-panel/layouts'
4) Log out and back in
5) Open Appearance and set Theme to "Numix"
